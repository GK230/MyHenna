            <p>
                I have had a childhood ambition to design jewellery. I think I was inspired by my parents Indian jewellery business,
                however I have always loved making patterns and working with delicate things, which lead me to my love of henna.
            </p>
            <p>
                I trained at the Carlton Institue for Beauty, where I learned basic henna making and applying skills
                and gained an insurance certificate. Following this I studied various styles of henna from around the world
                and created a portfolio of my own designs. I have worked at Henna parties, taken part in cultural events
                and have private clients.
